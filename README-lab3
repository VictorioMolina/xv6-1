Part1:

	For all process, page address 0 (first page address) PTE_P is set to 0
	When pagefault trigger for that page, the process will be killed for null pointer

Part2:

	exec is changed such that:
		The memory layout of any process will be:
		|null page|code|stack|heap|
		inside stack:
		|reserved address space|guardpg|stack|
		
	the proc->sz will include all the space inside stack including reserved spaces.

	proc->guardpg, proc->stacktop, proc->stacklastpg
	are added to keep track of stack info.

	Functions like cowuvm will skip the pages that are in the reserved spaces.

	The stack pages and the guard page are copy on fork

	All syscall arg checking functions like argptr will reject any address in the 
	guard page and reserved spaces
	special treatment was given to the init process for the those checking
	
	If the new guard page address needed for expanding stack is < proc->stacklastpg, 
	processes will be killed for stackoverflow
	
Part3:

	Nothing special was done. Followed instructions.
